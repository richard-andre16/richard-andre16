A passionate Full-Stack Developer who loves building scalable, user-friendly, and impactful digital solutions. I specialize in leveraging modern web technologies to transform ideas into real-world products that make a difference.

Over the past few years, Iâ€™ve worked on exciting projects such as dynamic websites, e-commerce platforms, school management systems, and engaging community-driven apps. Each project has strengthened my skills in problem-solving, collaboration, and delivering high-quality solutions on time.

Iâ€™ve developed extensive knowledge in:

Back-End: Node.js | Express | MongoDB | MySQL
Tools & Methods: Git | GitHub | Netlify | Heroku | Docker | Mobile/Responsive Development | API Integration | Agile/Scrum

Iâ€™m passionate about turning complex challenges into simple, elegant solutions and I enjoy working with teams that value innovation, creativity, and impact. Currently, Iâ€™m open to exploring full-stack development opportunities at startups, agencies, or established companies looking to scale.
